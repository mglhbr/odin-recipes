    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pizza is a popular dish that originated in Italy and is now enjoyed around the world. 
        It consists of a round, flattened base of dough that is usually made from wheat flour and water, and is topped with a variety of ingredients such as tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of meats and vegetables. 
        The pizza is then baked in a wood-fired oven or a conventional oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly. 
        Pizza has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations, but it was in Naples, Italy where the modern version of pizza as we know it today was created. 
        Today, there are many different styles of pizza, including thin crust, thick crust, and stuffed crust, and it can be found at pizzerias, restaurants, and even as a frozen or take-out option.
