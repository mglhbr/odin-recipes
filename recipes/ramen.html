    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Ramen is a type of Japanese noodle dish that has become popular around the world. 
        It consists of wheat noodles served in a broth made from chicken, pork, or beef, 
        and is typically garnished with a variety of toppings such as sliced pork, green onions, and boiled eggs. 
        The broth is seasoned with soy sauce or miso, and the noodles are often served al dente for a satisfying chew. 
        Ramen has a long history in Japan, with its origins dating back to the Meiji period in the late 1800s. 
        It has since become a beloved dish in Japan and beyond, with many variations and styles of ramen available at restaurants and food stalls around the world.

        In the following parts we would like to create such a dish, so we prepared a list of ingredients needed and a list of steps needed to make the dish.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ramen noodles:</strong> These are thin, wheat-based noodles that are traditionally used in Japanese cuisine. They are available in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can be purchased at most Asian supermarkets or online.</li>
        <li><strong>Broth:</strong> The broth is the foundation of the dish, and can be made from chicken, beef, pork, or a combination of these meats. You can also use a vegetable broth if you prefer a vegetarian option.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein:</strong> You can add any protein you like to your ramen, such as chicken, beef, pork, tofu, or seafood.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> You can add a variety of vegetables to your ramen, such as bok choy, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and carrots.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> To add flavor to your ramen, you can use seasonings such as soy sauce, miso paste, and sesame oil. You can also add chili oil or chili flakes if you like a bit of heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong> You can add a variety of garnishes to your ramen to add flavor and texture, such as green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds, and boiled eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You can also add other ingredients to your ramen, such as nori (dried seaweed) or bamboo shoots, for added flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the broth:</strong> While the noodles are cooking, prepare the broth by heating a separate pot over medium heat. Add the broth ingredients of your choice (such as chicken, beef, or vegetables) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the protein:</strong> While the broth is simmering, prepare the protein of your choice. If you are using meat, you can sear it in a pan over high heat until it is cooked through. If you are using tofu or seafood, you can cook it in the broth for a few minutes until it is cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the vegetables:</strong>  While the broth is simmering and the protein is cooking, prepare the vegetables of your choice. You can slice or chop them as desired, and then add them to the broth to cook until they are tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the dish:</strong> Once the noodles, broth, protein, and vegetables are ready, it's time to assemble the dish. Place the noodles in a bowl and ladle the broth and vegetables over them. Top with the protein of your choice, and any garnishes or seasonings you desire. Serve hot.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> If you like, you can also add a soft-boiled or marinated egg to your ramen dish. Simply bring a pot of water to a boil and gently lower in a large egg. Cook for 6-7 minutes for a soft-boiled egg, or longer for a harder yolk. Remove the egg from the water and let it cool slightly before peeling and slicing. Add it to your bowl of ramen when you are ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
